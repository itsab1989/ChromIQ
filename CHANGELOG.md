# Changelog

## v1.3.1
### Improved
- **Check & Refine start-over logic** now uses OR logic: starting over is recommended when more than 50% of individual patches exceed the ΔE threshold, *or* when more than 75% of strips are flagged. This prevents false "start over" recommendations on small charts where a few outlier patches flag most strips, while still correctly catching large charts where nearly every strip needs re-measuring.
- **Settings dialog** now shows author credit at the bottom.

## v1.3.0
### Added
- **Build progress feedback** — the Build Profile button now shows "Building Profile…" while colprof runs, and a thin progress bar appears below it so it is clear the app is working. A result dialog appears on completion offering to install the profile, go to Check & Refine, or dismiss.
### Improved
- **Gamut Mapping defaults** — the gamut source is now enabled by default (Perceptual + Saturation, sRGB from the ArgyllCMS ref folder). Previously both options were disabled, leaving colprof to use an internal default that is not optimised for any real working colour space. The two separate `-s`/`-S` checkboxes are replaced by a single selector, preventing conflicting settings.
- **Gamut Mapping tooltips** rewritten to explain practical outcomes ("colours outside your printer's range are compressed to fit…") rather than raw CLI flag descriptions.
- **Measure tab** — the tooltip for "Refine existing measurement" is now hidden when the option itself is hidden, reducing clutter when no `.ti3` file is present.
### Fixed
- The `-s` (perceptual-only gamut source) path and enabled state were not saved to settings; the option had no effect after restarting the app.

## v1.2.0
### Added
- **Smart ti2 loading** in Print and Measure tabs: when a `.ti2` file is loaded from outside the working folder, a copy dialog guides the user to name and import the chart files. When the file is already in the working folder, the user can choose to continue printing as-is or use it as the base for a new profile.
### Improved
- **Profile quality grading** now accounts for peak ΔE as well as average ΔE. A profile with an excellent average but high-error outlier patches is now graded accordingly, and the explanation tells the user which metric is limiting the grade.
- **Guided refinement** recommendation logic is now patch-based: the "start over" recommendation is only triggered when more than 50 % of individual patches exceed the threshold, not when 50 % of strips are flagged. This avoids false "start over" recommendations on small charts with a handful of outlier patches.
- Log file moved to `~/Library/Logs/ChromIQ/chromiq.log` (standard macOS location). The app no longer creates a `ChromIQ` folder in the user's home directory on launch.
### Fixed
- Per-patch profcheck results were sometimes lost due to a QProcess output-buffer race condition. The fix ensures all output is drained before the process finish callback runs.
- The profile quality assessment popup was not shown when `profcheck` exited with a non-zero code (its normal exit behaviour when errors are found).
- An unhandled exception in the quality report file-write no longer silently prevents the assessment dialog from appearing.

## v1.1.6
### Fixed
- A3 Portrait is now hidden in guided mode when i1Pro / i1Pro 2 / i1Pro 3 is selected, matching the existing behaviour for i1Pro 3 Plus. A3 Landscape is shown and selected automatically instead.

## v1.1.5
### Fixed
- i1Pro 3 Plus patch capacity was incorrectly assumed identical to the regular i1Pro. All paper sizes have now been measured with `-i3p` and the database updated (e.g. A4: 504 → 108, A3: 735 → 153). Charts for this instrument will now correctly fill the page.
- A3 Portrait is hidden in guided mode when i1Pro 3 Plus is selected — it yields only 153 patches vs 225 on A3 Landscape, so the landscape variant is offered and selected automatically.
### Improved
- Guided mode now adds grey-axis patches (`-g`) scaled to total patch count: `max(8, total // 30)`, capped at 64. Previously grey patches were always disabled.
- White and black patches (`-e`, `-B`) in guided mode now scale with page count: base + (pages − 1) × 2 per type.

## v1.1.3
### Fixed
- Tooltip (ⓘ) and settings (⚙) icons now render crisp on Retina / HiDPI displays instead of appearing blurry.

## v1.1.2
### Improved
- The universal DMG now runs **natively on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs** (universal2 fat binary). Previously it was arm64 only and required Rosetta on Intel machines.

## v1.1.1
### Improved
- macOS title bar now matches the dark app theme.
- Check & Refine: re-measurement threshold is now user-editable.
- Check & Refine: the resume option is hidden when no matching `.ti3` file exists.
- Tooltip buttons remain clickable even when their parent panel is collapsed.
### Fixed
- Button heights and vertical alignment corrected throughout the UI.

## v1.1.0
### Added
- **Check & Refine tab** — run `profcheck` on a finished profile, see per-patch ΔE results, and selectively re-measure only the worst patches with guided strip-by-strip instructions.
### Improved
- File open dialogs now show only relevant file types and include sidebar shortcuts for quick navigation.

## v1.0.3
### Fixed
- Pink / magenta screen artifact on Apple Silicon during measurement (disabled native file dialogs).
- App now auto-detects ArgyllCMS on launch and shows a clear setup guide if it is not found.
- Wrong-strip dialog now appears when chartread detects a mismatch during measurement.
- Unexpected colour-response warning dialog added (high ΔE on a known patch).
- "No instrument detected" dialog shown at measurement start instead of silent failure.
### Added
- Resume measurement flag (`-r`) exposed in measurement options.

## v1.0.2
### Added
- Calibration prompt dialog when chartread asks to position the instrument.
- Navigation instructions popup shown after instrument calibration completes.
- Completion dialog when all stripes have been successfully measured.
- Retry dialog on strip read failure.
### Improved
- Measurement settings are disabled while chartread is running to prevent accidental changes.

## v1.0.1
### Added
- Initial public release as a distributable DMG.
- Resolved macOS App Translocation crash (app must be run from /Applications).
- PyQt6 compatibility fix for macOS 15 Sequoia.
